    <h3 class="position-title">Project Manager</h3>
    <p class="about-paragraph">Michael Scott is the World's Best Project Manager (self-declared).<br>
        As the regional manager of CompuGlobalHiperMegaNet, Michael has<br>
        mastered the art of turning every office meeting into an improv<br>
        comedy show. Known for his unique management style, Michael <br>believes
        that friends make the best employees and that diversity <br> training is best
        delivered through inappropriate impressions.
